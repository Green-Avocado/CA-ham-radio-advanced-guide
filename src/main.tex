        \subsubsection{Fields}
        \begin{description}
            \item[electromagnetic field] the magnetic field created around a conductor carrying current.
            \item[magnetic field] a space around a magnet or a conductor where a magnetic force is present.

                The `Left-hand Rule':
                position the left hand with your thumb pointing in the direction of electron flow;
                encircle the conductor with the remaining fingers, the fingers point in the direction of the magnetic lines of force.
                Using conventional current flow, this would become the Right-hand rule.

                A magnetic field is oriented about a conductor in relation to the direction of electron flow \textbf{in the direction determined by the left-hand rule}.

            \item[electrostatic field] the electric field present between objects with different static electrical charges.

                An electrostatic field is the electric field present between objects with different static electrical charges.
                Voltage across a capacitor creates an electrostatic field between the plates.

            \item[electric field] a space where an electrical charge exerts a force (attraction or repulsion) on other charges.
        \end{description}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Electromagnetic and electrostatic fields are capable of storing energy.

                Energy in this state is \textbf{potential energy}.
        \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Capacitors}
        Capacitors store energy in an \textbf{electrostatic field}.
        The capacitance in \textbf{farads} is one factor influencing how much energy can be stored in a capacitor.
        One farad accepts a charge of one coulomb when subjected to one volt.

        Capacitive reactance is calculated as follows:
        $$ X_C = \frac{1}{2 \pi f C} $$

        \subsubsection{Inductors}
        Inductors store energy in an electromagnetic field.
        The inductance in \textbf{henries} is one factor influencing how much energy can be stored in an inductor.
        One henry produces one volt of counter EMF with current changing at a rate of one ampere per second.

        Inductive reactance is calculated as follows:
        $$ X_L = 2 \pi f L $$

        \subsubsection{Skin Effect}
        Skin Effect is the tendency of AC to flow in an increasingly thinner layer at the surface of a conductor as frequency increases.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Skin Effect causes most of an RF current to flow along the surface of a conductor.
            \item The resistance of a conductor different for RF currents than for direct currents because of the Skin Effect.
        \end{itemize}

        \subsection{Resistor-capacitor circuits}
        \subsubsection{Time constant}
        The time constant of an RC circuit (in seconds), is equal to the product of the circuit resistance (in ohms) and the circuit capacitance (in farads).
        $$ \tau = R \cdot C $$
        It is the time required to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{charge} the capacitor from an initial charge voltage of zero to approximately \textbf{63.2\%} of the value of an applied DC \textbf{voltage}, or
            \item \textbf{discharge} the capacitor to approximately \textbf{36.8\%} of its initial charge \textbf{voltage}.
        \end{itemize}

        When charging a capacitor, every time constant reduces the difference to the value of applied DC voltage by 63.2\%.
        $$ \Delta V_f = \Delta V_i \cdot 0.368^{t / \tau} $$
        Where $ \Delta V $ is the difference between the voltage of the capacitor and the applied DC voltage, and $ t $ is time in seconds.

        When discharging a capacitor, every time constant reduces the voltage of the capacitor by 63.2\%.
        $$ V_f = V_i \cdot 0.368^{t / \tau} $$
        Where $ V $ is the voltage of the capacitor and $ t $ is time in seconds.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Charging a capacitor, the voltage after 1, 2, and 5 times constants is respectively 63\%, 87\%, and 100\% of the final value.
            \item Discharging a capacitor, the voltage is respectively 37\% ($ 100 - 63 $) and 13\% ($ 100 - 87 $) of the initial voltage after 1 and 2 time constants.
        \end{itemize}

        \newpage

        \subsection{Resistor-inductor circuits}
        \subsubsection{Time constant}
        The time constant of an RL circuit (in seconds), is equal to the circuit inductance (in henries) divided by the circuit resistance (in ohms).
        $$ \tau = L / R $$
        It is the time required to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{build} the \textbf{current} in the circuit up to \textbf{63.2\%} of its maximum value.
        \end{itemize}

        When building current in a circuit, every time constant reduces the difference to the maximum value by 63.2\%.
        $$ \Delta I_f = \Delta I_i \cdot 0.368^{t / \tau} $$
        Where $ \Delta I $ is the difference between the current in a circuit and the maximum value, and $ t $ is time in seconds.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item The current after 1, 2 and 5 time constants is respectively 63\%, 87\%, and 100\% of the final value.
        \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Counter electromotive force}
        Back EMF or `counter electromotive force' is the voltage induced by changing current in an inductor. It is the force opposing changes in current through inductors.
        \textbf{Back EMF} is \textbf{A voltage that opposes the applied EMF}.

        \newpage

        \subsection{Resistor-inductor-capacitor circuits}
        \subsubsection{Resonance}
        Resonance occurs in an RLC circuit when the supply frequency causes the voltages across L and C to be equal and opposite in phase.
        At resonance, reactances are equal.
        $$ X_L = X_C $$

        The resonant frequency of an RLC circuit is calculated as follows for inductance in henries and capaciance in farads:
        $$ f = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{LC}} $$

        Restating the equation for frequency in megahertz, inductance in microhenries, and capacitance in picofarads results in the following equation:
        $$ f(\mathrm{MHz}) = \frac{1000}{2 \pi \sqrt{L (\mathrm{\mu H}) \cdot C (\mathrm{p F})}} $$

        These equations can be rearranged to solve for inductance or capacitance as follows:
        \begin{align*}
            L &= \frac{1}{4 \pi^2 f^2 C} \\
            C &= \frac{1}{4 \pi^2 f^2 L}
        \end{align*}

        Or in megahertz, microhenries, and picofarads:
        \begin{align*}
            L (\mathrm{\mu H}) &= \frac{1000000}{4 \pi^2 f (\mathrm{MHz})^2 C (\mathrm{p F})} \\
            C (\mathrm{p F}) &= \frac{1000000}{4 \pi^2 f (\mathrm{MHz})^2 L (\mathrm{\mu H})}
        \end{align*}

        \subsubsection{Quality factor}
        $$ Q = \frac{R}{X} $$
        A resistor often included in a parallel resonant circuit \textbf{to decrease the Q and increase the bandwidth}.
